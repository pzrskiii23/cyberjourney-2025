# OS-Independent Troubleshooting

## Common Symptoms
- Recognize hardware (overheating, noise) and software (slow, unresponsive) issues.

## Troubleshooting Process
1. **Identify** the problem (symptoms, errors).
2. **Research** solutions (forums, docs).
3. **Plan** steps to fix (start with simple).
4. **Test & verify** if solution works.
5. **Repeat** if unresolved, try next solution.
6. **Document** actions and results.

## Isolating Problems
- Disconnect/test hardware one by one.
- Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, disk).
- Check software configs for errors.

## Networking & Connectivity
- Check cables/connections.
- Confirm IP configuration.
- Use `ping`, `traceroute` for connectivity tests.

## Log Analysis
- Find and review relevant log files.
- Analyze error messages and events.
- Use log tools/scripts to spot issues.

**Goal:** Systematic approach to diagnose and fix issues, regardless of OS.
