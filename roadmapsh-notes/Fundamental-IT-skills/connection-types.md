# Connection Types and Their Function

- **Ethernet:** Wired, fast and reliable, ideal for LANs.
- **Wi-Fi:** Wireless, convenient and mobile, but can be slower/less stable.
- **Bluetooth:** Short-range wireless (up to ~10m), connects peripherals (headphones, keyboards).
- **Fiber-optic:** Uses light for very high-speed data over long distances (internet backbone, data centers).
- **Cellular (4G/5G):** Mobile devices connect via cellular networks, good coverage but variable speed.
- **NFC (Near Field Communication):** Very short-range (a few cm), used for contactless payments and pairing devices.
- **Infrared:** Line-of-sight wireless, often used for remote controls or short-distance device communication.

**Summary:**  
Each connection type balances speed, range, convenience, and use-case. Ethernet/fiber = fast/stable, Wi-Fi/cellular = mobility, Bluetooth/NFC/infrared = peripherals or special tasks.
