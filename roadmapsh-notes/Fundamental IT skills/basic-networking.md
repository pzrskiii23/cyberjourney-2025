# Basics of Computer Networking

- Networking = connecting computers/devices to share data/resources.
- Uses protocols (TCP/IP), hardware (routers, switches) to manage traffic.
- Topologies: star, mesh, bus, etc.
- Network types: LAN (local), WAN (wide).
- Basics help with data flow, troubleshooting, and efficient communication.
- Key concepts: 
  1. IP addressing (Assigning unique numbers (IP addresses) to each device on a network so they can communicate)
  2. Subnetting (Dividing a large network into smaller parts (subnets) to improve organization, security, and traffic management)
  3. DNS (Converts human-readable domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses that computers use)
  4. Security (Protecting the network and data from threats (hackers, malware) using tools like firewalls, encryption, secure passwords, and access control)
