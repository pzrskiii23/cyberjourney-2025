# Introduction to Cyber Security

## Offensive Security
- Simulating hacker tactics to find vulnerabilities (legally and ethically)
- Breaking into systems, exploiting bugs, finding loopholes
- Tools: Gobuster (brute-forcing directories), using Kali/Ubuntu VM
- Example: Used Gobuster to find `/bank-transfer` page, simulated unauthorized bank transfer

## Defensive Security
- Preventing and detecting intrusions (Blue Team)
- User awareness training, asset management, patching systems
- Setup and monitoring: Firewalls, IPS (Intrusion Prevention Systems), logging
- SOC (Security Operations Center): Monitors network for malicious activity, policy violations, and unauthorized access
- DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response): Handles cyber incidents, digital evidence, malware analysis

## Key Terms
- **SOC**: Security Operations Center â€“ team that monitors for malicious events
- **DFIR**: Digital Forensics and Incident Response
- **Ransomware**: Malware that locks files and demands payment

## Tools Mentioned
- Gobuster: Directory brute-forcing tool
- TryHackMe VM: Hands-on learning environment

## Example Scenario
- Used Gobuster to discover hidden admin pages
- Accessed a "bank-transfer" page and completed a simulated money transfer
- Saw confirmation in the fake banking app
